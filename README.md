My Scripts Collection

Welcome to my personal collection of scripts!
This repository contains various scripts I’ve written to automate tasks, solve problems, or experiment with different programming languages and tools.
What’s Inside?

    Shell scripts

    Python scripts

    Batch scripts

    Utility scripts

    And more...

Each script is intended to be self-contained and documented with comments to explain its purpose.
How to Use

    Browse the folder structure or search for the script you need.

    Check the script’s comments for usage instructions.

    Run the script in your terminal or environment as described.
